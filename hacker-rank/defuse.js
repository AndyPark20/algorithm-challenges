You have a bomb to defuse, and your time is running out! Your informer will provide you with a circular array code of length of n and a key k.
To decrypt the code, you must replace every number. All the numbers are replaced simultaneously.
If k > 0, replace the ith number with the sum of the next k numbers.
If k < 0, replace the ith number with the sum of the previous k numbers.
If k == 0, replace the ith number with 0.
As code is circular, the next element of code[n-1] is code[0], and the previous element of code[0] is code[n-1].
Given the circular array code and an integer key k, return the decrypted code to defuse the bomb!***/
const k = 3;
const code = [5, 7, 1, 4];
// 7,1,4,5=12
// 1,4,5,7=10
// 4,5,7,1=16
// 5,7,1,4=13

var decrypt = function (code, k) {
  let number = 0;
  let array = [];
  //if k >0;
  //loop thru the code array
  //use shift() to remove the first value
  //use push() to pushj the deleted item into the back of the array;
  // loop thru the re-assigned array with conditional looping up to length of k
  //Add values to number
  // push the number to the array
  for (let i = 0; i < code.length; i++) {
    let deletedValue = code.shift();
    code.push(deletedValue);
