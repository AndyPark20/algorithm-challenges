//INPUT
// first array (s and t)--> the distance of sams house (whatever falls in between counts)
// second array (a and b) --> the position of which apple and orange tree is located
// third array (m and n) -->how many apples and oranges have fallen
// fourth array (m) --> the distance at which the apples have fallen
// fifth array (n) --> the distance at which oranges have fallen
