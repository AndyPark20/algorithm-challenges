// Step 1: Shopping cart
//
// You are building a checkout system for a shop which only sells apples, oranges and mangos.
//
// Apples = $0.60
// Oranges = $0.25
// Mangos = $1.50
//
// Create a system which which takes a list of items and outputs the total cost
// For example: [ Apple, Apple, Orange, Apple, Mango ] => $3.55
//
// Make reasonable assumptions about the inputs to your solution;
// for example, an array of strings or an array of objects
//
// Step 2: Discounts
//
// The shop decides to introduce three new offers:
//
// Apples = buy two or more and get all apples at 50% discount
// Oranges = 3 for the price of 2
// Mango = buy one, get one free
//
// Update your checkout functions accordingly to handle the various offers.
//
// 'Apple, Orange, Mango' => $2.35
// 'Apple, Orange, Apple' => $0.85
// 'Apple, Apple, Orange, Apple, Mango' => $2.65
// 'Apple, Apple, Orange, Apple, Mango, Apple, Mango' => $2.95
// 'Mango, Mango, Mango, Apple, Apple, Orange, Orange, Orange, Apple, Mango' => $4.40
